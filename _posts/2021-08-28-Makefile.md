or use `man make`. The following are some templates for pasting.

### Generate a sequence.
It's useful in generate big datasets by many small files, e.g., 
```
E:=$(shell seq -f "%03g" 1 1 100)
```

In `shell`, it can be replaced by: 
```
E:=$(shell echo {1..5})
```

The multiple iteration are also supported,
```
E:=$(shell echo {1..5}_{1..5})
```

A quickly way to avoid for each can be done by
```
x:=$(shell echo {1..5}_{1..5}_{1..5})
grid:=$(subst _,\ ,$(x))
```

### Get the input and output
We usually need to list filenames in a directory, they are always the input of the program, e.g., list all files with suffix `.h5` 

```
srl:=$(wildcard ./input/*.h5)
```

The output often has the similar name with only string changed, e.g.,
```
dst:=$(srl:./input/%.h5=./output/%.h5)
```

### Target
the makefile need a target to execute, we focus on the target need iteration. For small iteration, you can  

```
E1:=$(shell echo {1..5})
E2:=$(shell echo {1..3})

target :=
target += $(foreach x, $(E1), $\
                $(foreach y, $(E2), $(shell echo $(x)/$(y).h5)))
```

It is __not__ recommended in large numbers, `foreach` is much faster.

```
target := $(foreach x, $(E1), $\
                $(foreach y, $(E2), $(shell echo $(x)/$(y).h5)))
```

For complex situations, we use function to iterate, here is an template.

```
xs:=$(shell seq -f "%03g" 0 1 9)
ys:=$(shell seq -f "%03g" 0 1 9)

define rule
recon/$(1)_$(2).h5:
	mkdir -p $$(dir $$@)
	python3 em.py -o $$@ --input $(1) $(2)

endef

$(foreach x,$(xs),$(foreach y,$(ys),$(eval $(call rule,$(x),$(y)))))
```
you also need a target:
```
all:$(foreach x,$(xs),$(foreach y,$(ys),recon/$(x)_$(y).h5))
```
Notice that 
+ __DO NOT__ add blanks in the variable. 
+ In template most `$` need to be __doubled__, despite the local and global variables.  

`Bash` style also works, but not recommanded.

```
all:
    @for x in $(E1);\
    do \
            for y in $(E2);\
            do \
                    echo $$x $$y; \
            done \
    done
```

Here is a more complex case, we need iterate multiple times (epoch), the results in each step should be recorded, we can use the following template:

```
define tpl_iter
$(guile (+ $(1) 1))/%.h5: data/type1/%.root $(1)/%.h5
    mkdir -p $$(dir $$@)
    python3 Recon_bak.py $(1) $$@ $$^
endef

$(foreach i,$(iterl),$(eval $(call tpl_iter,$(i))))
```


### Automatic variables

| variable | mean |
| --- | --- |
|  `$@`   | target  |
|  `$%`   | target member name  |
|  `$<`   | first prerequisite |
|  `$?`   | all prerequisites |
|  `$*`   | match `%` |

If we wart to specify the dependent file, use `word`,

```
$(word 2, $<)
```

If we need a calculator, use `bc`:
```
target:$(shell echo '$(x)+2000' | bc -l).h5
```

## Some frequent bugs:
+ remember to create the path
    ```
    mkdir -p $(dir $@)
    # or
    mkdir -p $(dirname $@)
    ```
+ `tab` is not equal to `space`, be careful to the editor.
