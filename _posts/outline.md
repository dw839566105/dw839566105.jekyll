#### 0. Simulation  
+ Need simulation generated at different axes
> Random vertex and energy (Sim Real Situation)
> 1. Simulated particle $\alpha$, $\beta$
>> Almost finished in 5 kt, may be not need in 1t, just to demonstrate that GEANT4 is not suitable for decay time constant.
> 2. Simulated energy from 0.5 - 2.5 MeV
>> Random sampling
> 3. Simulated decay time constant
>> a. Default time profile ($\tau_d$ = 26 ns)
>> b. Energy dependent time profile ($\tau_d = f(E)$)
>>> i. Need makefile sed 'Energy' and 'Decay time constant' at the same time.
>>> ii. Makefile need a random generator when energy is not fixed.
>>> iii. An assumption of relationship between energy and $\tau_d$
>
> Fixed vertex and Energy (Templates)
>
> 4. Vertex at different position
>> a. Vertex is defined as $\vec{x} = \{r,\theta,\phi\}$
>> b. Simulated vertex is in the grid of $\{r,\theta,\phi\}$
>>> i. $r$ from $[-R,R]$, step ~ $R/50$
>>> ii. $\theta$ from $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$, step $\pi/6$ (Need discussion)
>>> iii. $\phi$ from $[-\pi,\pi]$, step $\pi/3$
>>> iv. Energy can takes 1,1.5,2 MeV
>>> Total events $100*6*6 = 3600$
>>> Or the points are sparse in the center, but dense close to the boundry, total events < 1000.
>>> Each point 20000 beam. Per beam 1 event.
>>> Trigger: 10 PMTs. (Need to discuss when close to boundry)
>>> software: JSAP
###### Output:
1. root file alone axis
1.1 root file at 0.8 - 2.0 MeV
1.2 root files from [0,0,-0.64] ~ [0,0,+0.64] of each energy
1.3 root files at x,y,z,xy,xz,yz,xyz direction

#### 1. Legendre Coefficients: (Finished)
Use template to get an energy and radius dependent Legendre coefficient.

###### Output: 
3-d matrix(Energy\*radius\*Legendre coeff)  
###### Doubts: 
$Y_{l0}$ dependence: (important)
1. Trigger rate - lower trigger rate
2. Birks' law - ?

#### 2. Program main framework: Reconstruction Program (This part is almost finished)
This part is theory.
Likelihood function is a Poisson distribution. 
$p\sim\mathrm{Poisson}(n_i,\lambda)$
+ $n_i$ is waveform reconstruction
+ $\lambda$ is expected photons to esitimate 
$\mathcal{L}=\log \prod_i p_i = \sum_i \log p_i$

##### 2.a Naive likelihood (100 %)
$\lambda_i = E\cdot Y(E) \cdot \frac{\Omega}{4\pi}\cdot \eta \cdot \exp\{-\frac{d_i}{L}\}$
input: {pe, t_i, attenuation, quantum efficiency }
output: $\{E, x, y, z,\tau_d, t_0\}$  

##### 2.b Simulation templates (75 %)
$\lambda_i = \theta x_i $

#### 3. Processing Result of Simulation (Both method)
##### Input: Simulation data
Reconstructed vertex at certain grids
by Maximum Likelihood
##### 3.1 Map of Bias and Resolution Histogram
###### Output figure: 
+ 2-d Histogram $E$ vs $r$ 
> Slice of 1-d errorbar with bias and uncertainty 
> * 5 kt (naive ML)
>> Different energy at 0.5, 1, 2 MeV
>> Different radius at 0, 8, 10 m   
>
> * 1 t (naive ML and SH)
>> Different energy at 0.5, 1, 2 MeV
>> Different radius at each step (0.01 m)


##### 3.2 Map of Resolution Histogram By Naive ML

###### Output figure:
+ Reconstruction of 5 kt simulation of different $\tau_d$

> + 5 kt simulation data (Random vertex)
> + 2 types: energy dependent $\tau_d$
>    + Makefile needed 
>    + An assumption of relationship needed
>    + GEANT4 does not has this process

###### Input: Real data
##### 3.3 Why Naive ML does not work?

###### Output figure:
+ Shut down 1 PMT result (many sub-figures)

> + Shut down 1 PMT reconstruction result

##### 3.4 Real Data Reconstruction by SH
> + Energy spectrum vs radius (finish)

#### 4. Time infomation [Using EM] (Most difficult)
$t_c = t_i - t_f - t_0 \sim \mathrm{Time\ profile}$
##### 4.1 Naive likelihood (infeasible)
+ Prior of time profile is known 
##### 4.2 Spherical Harmonics (Benda Xu does)
+ Use template (Similarï¼Œhave difficulties when photon scattered, only 1 value will be calculated but the arrive time may have many values.)
##### 4.3 Use masks as EM (main job)
> 1. Use reconstructed vertex get an prior of time distribution $E$ vs $\tau_d$
> 2. Use mask as the input of next step

###### output figure:
+ plot the energy spectrum vs $\tau_d$

###### Extra task:
+ clusters
+ plot the $\alpha$, $\beta$ classification

##### Spherical Harmonics difficulties
    *1. difference of PMTs (calibration)
    *2. ignorance of PMTs (In simulation)
    *3. EM

#### EM:
###### Input:
+ Recon vertex
###### ???:
###### output:
+ Recon $\tau_d$

1. use recon vertex to recon $\tau_d$
2. get a mask of $E$ vs $\tau_d$
